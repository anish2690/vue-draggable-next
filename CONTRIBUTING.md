# Contributing to vue-draggable-next

We love your input! We want to make contributing to vue-draggable-next as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## üöÄ Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## üèóÔ∏è Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vue-draggable-next.git
cd vue-draggable-next

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run playground:dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

## üß™ Testing

We use Jest for testing. Please add tests for any new features or bug fixes.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run type checking
npm run test:types
```

### Writing Tests

```typescript
// __tests__/my-feature.spec.ts
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import { VueDraggableNext } from '../src'

describe('MyFeature', () => {
  it('should work correctly', () => {
    const wrapper = mount(VueDraggableNext, {
      props: {
        list: [{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }]
      }
    })
    
    expect(wrapper.exists()).toBe(true)
  })
})
```

## üìù Code Style

We use Prettier and ESLint to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Check formatting
npm run lint

# Fix formatting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns

- Use semantic commit messages
